# calculator

Your task is to create a simple calculator that asks the user for two numbers and an operation (+, -, x, รท), and computes and outputs the result.

## Steps

1. Always start by creating a new file in IDLE (Ctrl+n or Command+n).

    - Save the new file as `calculator.py` in your 10MCOD directory.

2. Use `input` to get the two numbers and the operation from the user.

    - What prompts are you going to display to the user?
    - How will they choose the operation? Will they choose from options a) Plus, b) Minus, etc? Or maybe type in the word 'plus'?

3. Use `if` statements to perform the correct operation and compute the result.

4. Output the result to the user. Remember to include some sort of message, like `The answer is: `

5. Use the resources below to guide you through the process.

## Assessment

| Level  | Expectations |
|--------|--------------|
| Bronze | Successfully adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two numbers |
| Silver | Handles floats as well as ints, clear and easy to use |
| Gold   | More operations, multiple numbers, error-proofing, etc. |

- **Note:** all code should be commented and you should have no redundant code
