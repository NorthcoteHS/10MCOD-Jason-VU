# magic8

In [Magic8Ball](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/magic-8-ball.html) (App Inventor), you learned how to use lists and random values to generate a new response each time the button was clicked.

Your task is to recreate magic8 for Python. To do so, you will have to learn how to use random numbers and if statements in Python.

## Steps

1. Always start by creating a new file in IDLE (Ctrl+n or Command+n).

    - Save the new file as `magic8.py` in your 10MCOD directory.

2. Use `input` to ask the user for a question.

    - What prompt are you going to display to the user?

3. Generate a random number (see resources).

4. Use `if` statements to print different responses based on the value of the random number.

5. Try challenging yourself by completing the silver, gold, and diamond expectations!

## Assessment

| Level  | Expectations |
|--------|--------------|
| Bronze | Lets the user enter a question, and prints a random response |
| Silver | Recognizes "key phrases" to which it gives unique responses |
| Gold   | Uses a while loop to repeat the whole process, asking each time if the user wants to ask another question |
| Diamond | Uses lists instead of if statements to choose the response |

- **Note:** all code should be commented and you should have no redundant code

At the end of each day, submit a zip of your entire working directory (including this module) on MyNHS.
